# ProAlignX: A Protein Sequence Alignment Tool using the SFA Algorithm


## Description
The Protein Sequence Alignment Tool is a powerful software tool based on the SFA (Structure-based Fingerprint Alignment) algorithm. It is designed to facilitate accurate and comprehensive alignment of protein sequences, aiding in functional annotation, protein structure prediction, drug discovery, and evolutionary biology studies.


## Features
- Robust and efficient protein sequence alignment using the SFA algorithm.
- Accurate identification of mutated positions along with similarity score.
- Scalable alignment capability for large-scale sequence datasets.
- Comprehensive visualization options, including alignment matrix heatmap, scatter plot, alignment table, and consensus sequence results.
- User-friendly interface for ease of use and intuitive interaction.


## Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 8.1 or later
- Python (download the latest version)
- Flask framework installation
- Required packages:
  - Flask
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - Biopython
  - colorama
  - termcolor
  - scipy


## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage
1. Ensure that all the required dependencies are installed, including Python and Flask framework.
2. Launch the command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the tool: `python app.py`
4. Open a web browser and access the tool at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
5. Enter the protein sequences you want to align and perform the alignment.
6. The result page will be displayed with the aligned sequences and visualizations.
